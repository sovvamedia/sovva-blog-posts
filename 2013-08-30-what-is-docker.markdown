[Docker][docker-home] has been grabbing attention for several months. But what is Docker? There's a lot of high really level allegory about [shipping containers][docker-home] and portable deployment. All of that is pretty cool, but entirely unsatisfying if you actually want to know what Docker is and what Docker does. And finding out isn't so simple if you're coming from outside the server operations scene.

<!--
A little while ago on On [Hacker News][hn] a few days ago there was a top 5 post titled [Docker: Git for deployment](http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2013/08/28/docker-git-for-deployment). Although HN is rife with linkbait, a comparison to Git is still compelling. There were many version control systems before Git. But since its release, Git has become the dominant, de facto VCS. Sure, people use Mercurial and SVN, but Git's extent is incalcuable and the rate at which Git achieved this reach suggest that it is, or was, indeed, the best thing since sliced bread.
